#LinkedList

- Custom class written for this demonstration

- Every node has a value and a pointer to the next node.

- Node.Value is null when a node is created

- Inserted nodes will automatically be given a value starting with 0 for the List.Head. The new node will be assigned as the value for Node.Next of the list's tail.

- The list instance contains four variables that you may modify: Head, Current, Previous, and Next.
	- Head is automatically set as the first node created in the list
	- Current will automatically be set to the new node when insterting a node.
	- Previous and Next will remain null unless you change their values.

- show available vars, then show available values
